  TCP Shunt
=============

For network-capacity-constrained load balancing. Allows a process to hand an
open TCP IP connection to another server. If the other server also has TCP
shunt installed it will do Direct Server Response - responding to the client
directly as if it were the original server. Otherwise it will act essentially
as a transparent proxy with data still flowing through the first server but
being handled by the second (so still job-balancing but doesn't really help the
network load in that case).

Linux only, implemented as a loadable linux module(s). Being developed at the
moment against Linux 2.6.31.

KEYWORDS:

tcp-splice, tcp-handoff, tcp-handover, tcpha, layer-3-switch, layer-7-switch, NAT, DNAT, SNAT

EXAMPLE:

1. client attempts to establish conn. on server1:80
2. server1 `accept()` and possibly does some work w/ connection
3. server1 does an ioctl call on the socket's fd saying it wants to hand the
   tcp connection over to server2:8080 - and specifies data it wants to send to
   server2:8080 as if it came from the client.
4. server2:8080 accept()s connection from server1 and gets data sent as if it's
   from a client.
5. server2:8080 talks to client directoy, masquerading as server1:80.
6. client is still talkng to server1:80, which is forwarding everything to server2:8080.
